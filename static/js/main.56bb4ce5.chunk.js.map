The applicant has to\n          provide information which is necessary for the review by the Remap\n          team. In the review process, reviewers confirm whether the applicant\n          actually is a person who has a right for the keyboard definition file\n          based on submitted information. If reviewers determine that the\n          submitted information is valid, the review request is approved and the\n          keyboard definition file becomes available.\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom={true}>\n          3.
